Welcome in this online course on SaaS MVP Engineering.


# Assignment 2
Congrats!! You now have your first "hello world" app up and running.

To claim you have an MPV now, would be a bit of an overstatement ;)

In order to get a head start, people often don't start from scratch, they start from "starter projects". Starter projects are typically bare bone apps that include basic styling, often a login system, a file layout reflecting best practices for the given framework, a collection of commonly used modules etc.

You'll find starter projects for virtually every self respecting framework:
* if you're into ruby on rails, you have https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer
* if laravel (php) is your thing: check https://github.com/andrewelkins/Laravel-4-Bootstrap-Starter-Site

For our little project here, we will be starting from a starter project for Meteor by The Meteor Chef: https://github.com/themeteorchef/base

This starter app contains decent styling via [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), a basic accounts system, JQuery and JQuery validation for forms, and a lot of other goodies.

So, for this assignment:
1. grab a copy of this base project at https://github.com/themeteorchef/base
1. Have it up and running in your local repository and
1. Change the title of the home page, in the navigation, from Base to MVP
1. Commit the code to your git repository

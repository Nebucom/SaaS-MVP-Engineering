# SaaS-MVP-Engineering

Welcome in this online course on SaaS MVP Engineering.


In the previous assignments, we built our MVP. Now it is time to put it online and let the world see your brilliant piece of work.

Like with the software itself, we're going to take an minimalistic approach here, leveraging as much as possible existing things. Therefor, we will deploy our MVP on a PaaS, platform as a service. As it happens, the company behind Meteor is offering such a PaaS.

The benefits of such a PaaS are trivial for us: no need to worry about installing and operating mongo, nodejs and stuff. All that is taken care of by the PaaS provider.

So without further ado, let's deploy.

## Assignment 4.2: some more tests
We have our first tests, but the usability still isn't what it should be. Shouldn't we provide a logged in user with extra navigation so they know they can setup a new dashboard? And shouldn't we automagically guide a user to a live dashboard after she filled out the new dashboard form?

Let's write these features BDD style. I'm not going to give you a lot of hint here, try for yourselves ;)
